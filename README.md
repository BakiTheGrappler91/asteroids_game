# asteroids_game
This is my take on the classic video game Asteroids coded completely from scratch.  I chose to use Pygame to build this project over other game engines like Unity and Godot as I have mainly learnt to code in python.

## The project

I greatly enjoyed building this project as Asteroids is one of my favourite classic games.  It proved to be quite as challenge as I had not built a game like this before.  The goal of this project was to produce near flawless visuals and gameplay without the use of tutorials, AI, etc.
